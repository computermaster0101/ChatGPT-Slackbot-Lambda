# ChatGPT-Slackbot


This is a placeholder and needs to be fixed. I think these are the steps i took but it needs to be repeated and better captured.

1 create lambda with function url from code

2 setup lambda with layer provided in repository

3 configure iam role with permission to invoke lambda

4 generate keys using your own generator

5 create slack app

6 setup slack app for /ChatGPT

7 add oAuth permission chat:write

8 fill in tokens in config_file.json

9 setup slack app for event app_mention

10 test and debug
